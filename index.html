                <h2>Problem Statement: Adult/Senior Citizens Care</h2>
              <p>People are having problems because of the lack of availability in the adult
                healthcare space and they feel as if they can not find the proper care for loved ones
                often settling for a non desirable option. Our solution should allow users access to a
                database with different adult/senior citizen healthcare providers.   </p>
